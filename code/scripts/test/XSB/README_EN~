 - The query can be modified changing the content of the file 'query'. The rules are in the file 'rules'.
If you want to extract the rules of the file 'pa.datalog', you must replace the following line in the script:

cat rules >> ./Tests/$directorio.pl

with this line:

./extraerReglas < ../$directorio/pa.datalog >> ./Tests/$directorio.pl

 - It is necesary to grant execution permission to 'generadorXSB'.
