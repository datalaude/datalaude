1 - Put the directory 'Lua' in the same directory that the directories which contains the files with extension .tuples. For example:
 /home/freets/
 /home/joone/
 /home/Lua/

This way, the test files for freets and joone will be generated.

2 - Run 'generadorLua', which is in the folder of Lua.
3 - The test files will be generated in the folder "Tests" in the directory "Lua".


----
 - The query can be modified changing the content of the file 'query'. The rules are in the file 'rules'.
If you want to extract the rules of the file 'pa.datalog', you must replace the following line in the script:

cat rules >> ./Tests/$directorio.pl

with this line:

./extraerReglas < ../$directorio/pa.datalog >> ./Tests/$directorio.pl

 - It is necesary to grant execution permission to 'generadorLua'.
