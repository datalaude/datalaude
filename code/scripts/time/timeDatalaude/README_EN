1. Put into the directory timeDatalaude/Files the folder with the test files.
2. Run './scriptTimeDatalaude' (execution permission must be granted)
3. The files will be generated in ./Time

---

If the script doesn't work, try to replace the following line:

maude.linux $j/kk | grep "rewrites" >> ./Time/$fichero.txt;

with this one:

maude $j/kk | grep "rewrites" >> ./Time/$fichero.txt;
